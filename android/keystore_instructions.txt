Keystore generation & upload instructions
=========================================

1) Generate keystore on a computer (recommended) with Java JDK installed:
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload

   You'll be prompted for:
   - Keystore password
   - Your name, organization, location (can be placeholders)
   - Key password (can be same as keystore password)

   This produces 'upload-keystore.jks' file.

2) Convert keystore to base64 for GitHub Secrets (Linux / macOS):
   base64 upload-keystore.jks > upload-keystore.jks.base64
   cat upload-keystore.jks.base64  # copy the full base64 text

   On Windows (PowerShell):
   [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("upload-keystore.jks")) > upload-keystore.jks.base64
   Get-Content upload-keystore.jks.base64

3) In your GitHub repository: Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret
   Add the following secrets:
   - KEYSTORE_BASE64 : (paste the base64 content of upload-keystore.jks.base64)
   - KEYSTORE_PASSWORD : your keystore password
   - KEY_ALIAS : the alias you used (e.g., upload)
   - KEY_PASSWORD : the key password

4) Commit the workflow file (.github/workflows/flutter_build_signed.yml) to your repository
   and commit the android/key.properties template if you want local builds (note: don't commit actual secrets).

5) Push to main branch. GitHub Actions will decode the keystore and build signed AAB/APK.

Security notes:
- Never commit your raw keystore file or passwords to the repository.
- Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive values.
- Optionally, you can split KEYSTORE_BASE64 into chunks if size limits apply; generally secrets can hold large base64 content but check limits for your account.
